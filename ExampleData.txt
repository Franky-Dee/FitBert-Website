We define an observation, or record, as the set of recorded values of variables associated with a single entity. An observation is often displayed as a row of values in a spreadsheet or database in which the columns correspond to the variables.
In an unsupervised learning application, there is no outcome variable to predict; rather, the goal is to use the variable values to identify relationships between obser-vations. Because unsupervised learning approaches are capable of describing patterns and relationships in large data sets with many observations of several variables, these approaches can be thought of as high-dimensional descriptive analytics. Without an explicit outcome (or one that is objectively known), there is no definitive measure of accuracy. Instead, qualitative assessments, such as the interpretability of the results or how well they match expert judg-ment, are often used to assess the results from an unsupervised learning method.
The goal of cluster analysis is to organize observations into similar groups based on the observed variables. Cluster analysis is commonly used in marketing to divide con-sumers into different homogeneous groups, a process known as market segmentation. Identifying different clusters of consumers allows a firm to tailor marketing strategies for each segment. However, such pattern analysis is not limited to situations in which observations are customers. Cluster analysis is applicable to a wide variety of data.
