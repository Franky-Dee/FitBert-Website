# FitBert-Website
## This repository contains all source code relevant to the website that will be integrated with the fitBert AI.

The website contains a landing page, where users are asked to enter their login information or requets access to an account. Once they have done this they are allowed to proceed to the following page which is where users can begin creating new multiple choice tests, alternatively the user can select an option to edit old tests created by the user. The FitBert AI will then help the user to efficiently create multiple choice tests which can then be outputted in various formats.

## Development Plan (For remaining development)

- [x] Complete design and functionality of login page
- [ ] Implement error handling and helper bot "Bert" on the "Login" page
- [ ] Implement functionality to Log Out
- [x] Complete design of the "Create Test" page (either using a set amount of sections that are hidden, or generating new sections)
- [ ] Implement the functionality of the "Create Test" page (intergrate endpoints into the AI that are called on the backend)
- [ ] Implement error handling and helper bot "Bert" on the "Create Test" page
- [ ] Create the design of the "Edit Old Test" page
- [ ] Create functionality for the "Edit Old Tests" page (old tests that are created are linked to the users account, old tests stored as text on the backend to be accessed)
- [ ] Consider Azure as a deployment method
- [ ] Set up the system to be accessed on the NWU network (Either with Azure, or locally hosted)
